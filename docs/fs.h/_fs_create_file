_fs_create_file() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
_fs_create_file() - Deletes a file from the filesystem

Synopsis ---------------

#include "fs.h"

FILE _fs_create_file(MountPoint *mp, char filename[8]);

Description ------------

The _fs_create_file() function performs the creation of a file with name
specified by filename that will reside on the mountpoint mp. This causes
the allocation of the next free fspointer as well as the next free sector. The
FILE struct that is constructed is placed on the stack.

This also initializes the first sector of the file by creating a header of 'F'
'I''L''E'. The sector is also blanked out with 0s to allow for free writing.

mp - The mountpoint to create the file on

filename - The name of the file to be created.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful creation of the file a FILE struct is returned that represents
the file. 

Errors -----------------

If any of the calls that allocate or find free sectors/fspointers, the
FS_STATUS of the functions are returned via file->code.
