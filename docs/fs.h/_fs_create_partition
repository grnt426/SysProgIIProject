Name -------------------
_fs_create_partition() - Creates a partition on the master boot record

Synopsis ---------------

#include "fs.h"

FS_STATUS _fs_create_partition(ATADevice *dev, Uint32 start, Uint32 size,
	Uint8 index);

Description ------------

The _fs_create_partition() function creates a partition of the ATADevice 
specified by dev.

The partition will begin at the sector specified by start. The partition will
be the number of sectors in length specified by size. The partition will be
the nth partition specified by index to be defined on the master boot record.

If the size is not evenly divisible by FS_SECT_PER_IB, the partition will be
expanded to the next largest multiple of FS_SECT_PER_IB.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful creation of the partition, FS_SUCCESS will be returned.

Errors -----------------

If the index is greater than the maximum number of primary partitions of a
standard MBR, FS_ERR_BADINDEX is returned.

If the size of the partition is less than or equal to 4, FS_ERR_TOOSMALL is
returned.

If the size of the partition is larger than the ATADevice OR the size plus
the start of the partition is larger than the ATADevice, FS_ERR_TOOBIG is
returned.
