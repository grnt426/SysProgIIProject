_fs_find_empty_fspointer() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
_fs_find_empty_fspointer() - find the first fspointer entry in the index blocks

Synopsis ---------------

#include "fs.h"

FILE _fs_find_empty_fspointer(MountPoint *mp);

Description ------------

The _fs_find_empty_sector() function finds the first unallocated fspointers from
the index blocks of a DERP_FS partition. The returned FILE struct is allocated
on the stack, not allocated from the global array of FILE structs. Therefore it
does not need to be cleared or unallocated when finished with it.

mp - The mountpoint to search for unallocated fspointer

Return Value -----------

Upon successful finding of an unallocated fspointer, a FILE struct is created
that defines the location of the fspointer and is returned.

Errors -----------------

If no free fspointers can be found, then a FILE struct is still returned but it
is not initialized with the exception of f->code which is set to FS_ERR_NO_FP.
