_fs_find_file() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
_fs_find_file() - Finds a file in the filesystem

Synopsis ---------------

#include "fs.h"

FILE _fs_find_file(MountPoint *mp, char filename[8]);

Description ------------

The _fs_find_file() function performs the creation of a file with name
specified by filename that will reside on the mountpoint mp. This causes
the allocation of the next free fspointer as well as the next free sector. The
FILE struct that is constructed is placed on the stack.

This also initializes the first sector of the file by creating a header of 'F'
'I''L''E'. The sector is also blanked out with 0s to allow for free writing.

mp - The mountpoint to search for the file

filename - The name of the file to be found

Return Value -----------

Upon successful finding of the file a FILE struct is returned that represents
the file. File->code should be set to FS_SUCCESS

Errors -----------------

If the file could not be found in the filesystem, FS_ERR_FILENOTFOUND is
returned via file->code.
