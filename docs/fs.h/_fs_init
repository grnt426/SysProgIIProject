_fs_init() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
_fs_init() - Initialize global ATA devices

Synopsis ---------------

#include "fs.h"

void _fs_init(void);

Description ------------

The _fs_init() function initializes all of the ATA devices found during the
boot process. This is accomplished by probing the ATA device for DERP_FS
partitions. If no ATA devices or DERP_FS filesystems are found, an error
message is printed to the console.

Return Value -----------

[ None ]

Errors -----------------

If no ATA devices are found, an error message is printed to the console.
If no DERP_FS partitions are found, an error message is printed to the console.
Neither condition is troublesome enough to warrant stopping the system.
