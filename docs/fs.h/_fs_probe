_fs_probe() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
_fs_probe() - Initialize global ATA devices

Synopsis ---------------

#include "fs.h"

void _fs_probe(ATADevice *dev);

Description ------------

The _fs_probe() function probes the ATADevice specified by dev for the
existance of any DERP_FS partitions. The boundries of partitions are determined
by reading the start sector and size in sectors of the partition specified in
the MBR. These formats follow the standard MBR format. Every partition that
is found is checked to see if it is DERP_FS by reading the first partition of
the partition and checking to see if the first 4 bytes are 'D''E''R''P'. If
they do not match, then the partition is not DERP_FS.

Each partition that is found that is DERP_FS is stored in the global
mount_points array as a MountPoint struct. The count of mount_point_count
is incremented. 

Return Value -----------

[ None ]

Errors -----------------

Nothing can error out this function.
