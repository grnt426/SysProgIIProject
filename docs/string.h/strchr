strchr() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
strchr() - locate character in string.

Synopsis ---------------

#include "string.h"

void strchr( const char *s, int c );

Description ------------

The strchr() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the
character c in the string s.

The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character
c in the string s.

The strchrnul() function is like strchr() except that if c is not found in s, 
then it returns a pointer to the null byte at the end of s, rather than NULL.

Here "character" means "byte"; these functions do not work with wide or 
multibyte characters. 

Return Value -----------

The strchr() and strrchr() functions return a pointer to the matched character
or NULL if the character is not found.

The strchrnul() function returns a pointer to the matched character, or a
pointer to the null byte at the end of s (i.e., s+strlen(s)) if the character
is not found.
