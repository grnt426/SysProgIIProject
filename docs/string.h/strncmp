#include "string.h"

void strncmp( const char *s1, const char *s2 );

integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found, respectively,
to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.

The strncmp() function is similar, except it only compares the first (at most)
n characters of s1 and s2.

s1	-	The string to compare against.

s2	-	The string to compare with.

Return Value -----------

The strcmp() and strncmp() functions return an integer less than, equal
to, or greater than zero if s1 (or the first n bytes thereof) is found,
respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.
