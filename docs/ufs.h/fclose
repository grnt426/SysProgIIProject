fclose() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
fclose() - close a file pointer and unallocate it

Synopsis ---------------

#include "ufs.h"

FS_STATUS fclose(FILE *file);

Description ------------

The fclose() function closes and unallocates the filepointer specified by file.
Before unallocating the filepointer, the buffer is flushed to the disk, as if
fflush(file) had been called. Then the file pointer is unallocated by setting
file->code to FS_AVAILABLE.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful closure of the filepointer, FS_SUCCESS will be returned.

Errors -----------------

If there was an error writing to the disk, FS_ERR_DISKFAULT will be returned.
If the file parameter is NULL or file->code is FS_AVAILABLE, FS_ERR_BADFILE
will be returned.
