fdelete() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
fdelete() - delete a file and unallocate it

Synopsis ---------------

#include "ufs.h"

FS_STATUS fdelete(FILE *file);

Description ------------

The fdelete() function closes and unallocates the filepointer specified by
file, and then deletes the file from the filesystem. The closing and
deallocation of the filepointer is the same as if fclose() on the file had been
called. The removal of the file from the filesystem causes a removal of the
file from the filesystem's nametables and index blocks and marks each sector
of the file as available.

Return Value -----------

Upon successfule closure and removal of the file from the filesystem, 
FS_SUCCESS will be returned.

Errors -----------------

If the file was NULL or file->code was FS_AVAILABLE, FS_ERR_BADFILE will be
returned and the changes to the filesystem will not be performed.
