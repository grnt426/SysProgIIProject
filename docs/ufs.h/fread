fread() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
fread() - read bytes from a file into a buffer

Synopsis ---------------

#include "ufs.h"

Uint32 fread(FILE *file, char *buffer, Uint32 size);

Description ------------

The fread() function reads bytes from the filepointer specified by file into
the character array specified by buffer. At maximum, size bytes will be read
into the array. Reading starts from the internal pointer of the file.

If reading of size bytes would cause reading past the end of the file, as many
bytes as can be read from the file will be read into the buffer and the number
of bytes read will be returned. If reading will cause reading into an adjacent
sector of the file, the filepointer's internal buffer will be flushed and
updated with the next sector's information.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful reading of the file, the number of bytes read will be returned.
If this is less than the number specified in size, it is because the number of
bytes in size would cause reading past the end of the file.

Errors -----------------

0 will be returned if the filepointer specified by file is NULL or if
file->code is set to FS_AVAILABLE.
