fseek() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
fseek() - reposition a filepointer

Synopsis ---------------

#include "ufs.h"

FS_STATUS fseek(FILE *file, Uint32 offset, FS_FILE_SEEK dir);

Description ------------

The fdelete() function sets the internal pointer of the filepointer specified
by file. The position is calculated depenedant upon the current position of the
internal pointer, the number of bytes to seek, specified by offset, and the
direction to seek, specified by dir. 

If dir is set to FS_SEEK_ABS, the internal pointer will be set to the value of
offset. This seeks to an absolute position in the file, relative to the
beginning of the file.

If dir is set to FS_SEEK_REL, the internal pointer will be set to the current
value of the internal pointer plus the value of offset. This seeks to a
position in the file relative to the current position.

If dir is set to FS_SEEK_REL_REV, the internal pointer will be set to the
current value of the internal pointer minus the value of offset. This seeks to
a position in the file reverse, relative to the current position.

If seeking within the file will cause seeking into a sector different than the
one that is already buffered, the filepointer will be flushed and the new
sector will be stored in the file's buffer.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful seeking of the file, FS_SUCCESS will be returned. Other
statuses are returned on error conditions.

Errors -----------------

If the file was NULL or file->code was FS_AVAILABLE, FS_ERR_BADFILE will be
returned.

If the calculated offset of the file is outside the size of the file,
FS_INVALID_OFFSET will be returned.
