fwrite() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
fwrite() - read bytes from a file into a buffer

Synopsis ---------------

#include "ufs.h"

Uint32 fwrite(FILE *file, char *buffer, Uint32 size);

Description ------------

The fwrite() function writes bytes to the filepointer specified by file from
the character array specified by buffer. The number specified by size is the
number of bytes to write to the file. File writing starts at the internal
pointer of the file.

If writingg of size bytes would cause writing past the end of the file, the
file is expanded to contain the bytes written. This will update the size of the
file, as well. Writing may cause a new sector to be allocated or may cross into
an adjacent sector of the file. This will cause the internal buffer to be 
flushed and if necessary a new sector to be allocated. In both situations, the
internal buffer will be updated with the new sector.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful writing of the file, the number of bytes written will be
returned.

Errors -----------------

0 will be returned if the filepointer specified by file is NULL or if
file->code is set to FS_AVAILABLE.
